# Model training workflows

Project-MTee machine translation models can be trained in two different ways:

1. multilingual model with modular architecture (scripts in the folder "modular")
2. bilingual and single directional models (scripts in the folder "single_direction")

Detailed instructions for both of the methods can be found in their respective folders.
